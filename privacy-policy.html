    <h1>AniKot Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2024,12,19</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to AniKot, an open-source mobile application showcasing anime content, built with Kotlin Multiplatform. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and share data when you use AniKot.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>AniKot, as an open-source app, does not collect any personal information directly from you. This means we don't collect data like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Username (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Phone number</li>
      <li>Payment information (since the app is free)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, we may collect some non-personal information automatically, which helps us improve the app experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect basic information about your device, such as the device type, operating system version, and unique identifier. This helps us understand how different devices run the app and identify potential compatibility issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage data about your interaction with the app. This includes features you access, frequency of use, and overall app performance. This data helps us improve user experience and prioritize features based on user behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The non-personal information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Providing Accurate Information:</strong> Location data (if enabled with your permission) can be used to display localized anime content relevant to your region.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimizing App Performance:</strong> Device and usage data helps us analyze app performance, identify bugs, and ensure smooth operation across various devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Improving User Experience:</strong> We use anonymous usage data to understand how users interact with the app and identify areas for improvement. This helps us prioritize features and functionalities that enhance the overall user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>AniKot may utilize third-party services that have their own privacy policies. These services may collect non-personal information for their own purposes. Here's a list of potential third-party services and links to their privacy policies (if applicable):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics Services (e.g., Google Analytics):</strong> We might use analytics services to understand user behavior and improve the app based on usage patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Crash Reporting Services (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics):</strong> These services help us identify and fix any crashes or bugs within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your device and any information you choose to share with the app (like location data, if applicable). We implement commercially reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute data security.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>AniKot is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or comply with legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the updated policy on our website or within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please don't hesitate to contact us through the app's support channels (if available) or reach out to the open-source repository. You can also contact us via email at: [yeshuwahane@gmail.com].</p>

    <p>By using AniKot, you agree to the collection and use of data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
